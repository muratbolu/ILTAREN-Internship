- `Bus.tpp` is a helper class that can store buses with either constant or
  alternating periods.
- `FFT.tpp` is an unused namespace that has procedures to calculate Fourier
  transform in O(NlogN) complexity.
- `Maybe.tpp` is an unused class that mimics `std::optional`. I couldn't
  manage to write it correctly.
- `Timer.tpp` is a namespace with two helper classes, `Time` and `Duration`,
  that are used in keeping track of bus periods.
